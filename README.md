💈 Barber Shop Booking System

This is a booking system tailored for barber shops, allowing users to easily reserve a spot for a haircut through a business's specific app.
🧾 Booking Flow

    Select Service – Choose from the services offered (e.g., haircut, beard trim, etc.)

    Choose Shop – If the business operates multiple locations, select the preferred shop

    Pick Barber – When available, users can select a specific barber

    Set Date & Time – Pick a convenient time slot for the appointment

    Enter Personal Details – Provide name, email, and phone number

🔐 Phone Verification via Viber

After entering their phone number, users will receive an OTP via Viber to validate their identity:

    ✅ If the OTP is confirmed, the booking is validated and the user is notified

    ⚠️ If verification fails, the booking still stands but is marked as unvalidated, and the user is informed accordingly

This approach adds an extra layer of reliability while keeping the process smooth for the user.
